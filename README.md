# Central Link Of Trust Contract

This NEAR smart contract implements a simple "trust network" model. Users register on-chain, set trust relationships, and block or unblock other users.

## Overview

- **Hashed User IDs**  
  The contract identifies users by the Base58-encoded SHA-256 hash of their account IDs. 
- **Trust Network**  
  Each user stores a list of `(other_user, level)` pairs, where `level âˆˆ [0,1]`.
- **Blocking**  
  Users can block others. When blocked, the blocked user cannot trust or interact with the blocker.
- **Storage Costs**  
  Additional data requires attaching enough NEAR for storage. Surplus deposit is refunded.

## Features

- **Registering / Creating**  
  Users appear automatically once they modify their public profile or trust another user.
- **Updating Profile**  
  Users can modify a string-based `public_profile`.
- **Trust / Untrust**  
  A user can set or remove trust levels to other hashed IDs.
- **Block / Unblock**  
  A user can block or unblock specific hashed IDs.
- **Delete Account**  
  Users can delete their on-chain record. Any leftover deposit is refunded.

## Methods

- **`modify_public_profile(profile: String)`**  
  Updates a user's `public_profile`.
- **`trust(user_id: String, level: f32)`**  
  Sets a trust level `[0..1]`; `0.0` effectively untrusts.  
- **`untrust(user_id: String)`**  
  Removes any trust record to `user_id`.
- **`block_user(user_id: String)`**  
  Blocks `user_id`; also removes any trust that `user_id` had to you.
- **`unblock_user(user_id: String)`**  
  Removes a block.
- **`delete_user()`**  
  Permanently removes the user from contract storage, refunding their deposit.
